            3. Listings &amp; Plate Ownership
          </h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              By listing a registration, you confirm you are the legal owner or
              have written permission to sell it.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must hold the correct documentation (e.g. V5C, V750, V778) and
              provide it when requested.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must not misrepresent the registration, its eligibility for a
              vehicle, or its legal status.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may edit, suspend or remove any listing at our discretion,
              including where we suspect fraud, misrepresentation, or breach of
              DVLA guidance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">4. Auction Format</h3>
          <p>
            Auctions typically run on a weekly cycle, with plates added into a
            live auction window. Exact timings and scheduling may be adjusted by
            us from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>Key auction rules include (but are not limited to):</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              All bids placed are legally binding offers to purchase if you win.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must ensure you have the funds available to complete the
              purchase, including any fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reserve prices are hidden from bidders. If the reserve is not met,
              the plate does not have to be sold.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may operate a soft-close system. Bids placed close to the end
              of the auction may extend the auction end time to reduce
              &quot;sniping&quot;.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">5. Buy Now</h3>
          <p>Some plates may offer a Buy Now option. Where available:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              Using Buy Now places an immediate commitment to purchase at the
              displayed price.
            </li>
            <li>
              The auction will end once Buy Now is used, and the listing will be
              treated as sold (subject to successful payment and transfer).
            </li>
            <li>
              You must complete payment and any required documentation promptly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">6. Reserve Prices</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              The seller may set a reserve price (minimum acceptable sale
              price). This value is not shown publicly.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the final bid is below the reserve price, the seller is not
              obliged to complete the sale.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the final bid is at or above the reserve price, the plate
              should be treated as sold and both parties are expected to
              complete the transaction.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">7. Fees</h3>

          <p className="font-semibold">7.1 Listing Fees</p>
          <p>
            Listing may be free during introductory or promotional periods. We
            reserve the right to introduce or amend listing fees in the future,
            and will make such fees clear before you list.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold mt-2">7.2 Commission</p>
          <p>
            A commission fee may be charged on successful sales. Commission is
            normally calculated as a percentage of the final sale price and is
            deducted from the seller&apos;s proceeds. No commission is usually
            charged if the plate does not sell.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold mt-2">
            7.3 DVLA Assignment Fee (&pound;80.00)
          </p>
          <p>
            A &pound;80.00 fee is added to all winning bids to cover the DVLA
            assignment/transfer process. AuctionMyPlate.co.uk has no affiliation
            with DVLA; this fee is to facilitate the paperwork and processing
            associated with the registration.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold mt-2">7.4 Refunds</p>
          <p>
            Fees and commissions are generally non-refundable unless we are
            required by law to issue a refund, or we expressly agree to one in
            writing.
          </p>
