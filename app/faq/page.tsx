            DVLA is the government body that legally moves the registration
            number from one keeper or certificate to another. AuctionMyPlate
            acts as the paperwork middle-man: we collect the buyer&apos;s and
            seller&apos;s documents, prepare the DVLA application, submit it,
            and confirm to both parties when the transfer is complete.
