            <p>
              Auctions typically run on a weekly cycle, with plates added into
              a live auction window. Exact timings and scheduling may be
              adjusted by us from time to time.
            </p>

              Key auction rules include (but are not limited to):
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
              <li>
                All bids placed are legally binding offers to purchase if you
                win, subject to these Terms and successful payment and transfer.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must ensure you have the funds available to complete the
                purchase, including any fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reserve prices are hidden from bidders. If the reserve is not
                met, the plate does not have to be sold.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may operate a soft-close system. Bids placed close to the
                end of the auction may extend the auction end time to reduce
                &quot;sniping&quot;.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may cancel or void an auction where we reasonably suspect
                error, fraud, technical issues or other exceptional
                circumstances.

              Listing may be free during introductory or promotional periods.
              We reserve the right to introduce or amend listing fees in the

            </h3>
            <p>
              A commission fee may be charged on successful sales. Commission is
              normally calculated as a percentage of the final sale price and
              is deducted from the seller&apos;s proceeds. No commission is
              usually charged if the plate does not sell.

            <p>
              A <strong>£80.00 fee</strong> is added to all winning bids to cover
              the DVLA assignment/transfer process. AuctionMyPlate.co.uk has no
              affiliation with DVLA; this fee is to facilitate the paperwork and

            <p>
              Buyers are responsible for any additional costs, such as number
              plate manufacture, fitting, and any taxes or charges levied by
              third parties. Sellers are responsible for any tax that may arise

            <p>
              Fees and commissions are generally non-refundable unless we are
              required by law to issue a refund, or we expressly agree to one
              in writing. Where a refund is issued, it may be limited to the

              We provide the platform and tools for buyers and sellers to
